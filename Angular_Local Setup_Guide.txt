Open command prompt

Go to the folder you have downloaded or clone your project rentme-ui

Mine is under C:\RentMe\RentMe

The way to go the folder is :
cd <Folder Path> Like below:

cd C:\RentMe\RentMe

after this if you have installed the visual studio and node js, following command should work:

cd project direcotry path and type
code .
(It opens the project in visualstudio software)

ng serve --open

ng build

Steps to clone project into local machine:
The working solution for me was

npm install
